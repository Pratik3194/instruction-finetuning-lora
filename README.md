# Instruction Fine-Tuning with LoRA

This repository demonstrates **instruction fine-tuning** using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for large language models.  
The project fine-tunes models to better follow task-specific instructions while keeping training efficient and lightweight.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **LoRA Fine-Tuning**: Parameter-efficient training approach.
- **Instruction Fine-Tuning**: Improves model's ability to follow user instructions.
- **Lightweight Implementation**: Train without modifying the full model weights.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: End-to-end training pipeline in one place.
